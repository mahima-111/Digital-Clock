# Digital-Clock
# 
* This is a digital clock I created using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
* It displays date and time. It shows time in both 12 and 24 hour formats. One can switch between 12 and 24 hour time formats.
* I made use of javascript date methods.
* The project is completely responsive. I however did the clock to be vertical instead of horizontal on small screens so they can view it in landscape mode.
* I gave it a nice UI by using Vanilla CSS. I added animation, glassomorphic effect on clock container to make it look pretty.
